## Synopsis

A "What Trailer Park Boys Are You" quiz in nothing but HTML and JavaScript. It scores people on two axis: how lawful they are and how methodical they are, and assigns a character based on the score.

## Examples

You can take the quiz [Here](http://technoccult.net/wp-content/uploads/TPBQuiz/).

## Motivation

This is purely a learning project. It's my second JavaScript project. It's mostly a proof of concept for the two axis scoring methodology. I'm sure I'm not the first person to use this for a "What $blank are you?" quiz, but I think it's a useful way to evaluate multiple options without having to increase the number of questions or chooses.

## Roadmap/Contributions

Soon I'd like to make it more visually appealing, add images and textual explanations for the results, and use the write.element function to write the result to the page instead of using an alert. I also need to add validation to the form so that you can't submit without filling out all the answers. As mentioned above, this is a learning project/proof of concept. Later I'll be looking at JQuery.

There are a bunch of other things I'd like to improve. I'd like to be able to grab the responses as an array, instead of creating a variable for each one. If someone knows how to do this, please let me know. I saw a StackOverflow answer, which I can't find now, that suggested it was possible but I wasn't able to get it working.

Eventually I'd like to make this into a template that other people could easily use to  Then I'd like to use two functions to add up the even and odd responses. The idea is to make it easier to add questions without having to modify the code. Likewise, I'd like to separate the scoring from the character descriptions, to make that easier to modify as well, and make the scoring adaptable to the total number of questions.
